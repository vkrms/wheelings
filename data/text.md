## a.k.a Feelings Wheel

From a very young age, we are disconnected from our feelings. Our brain hemispheres literally become detached from each other due to the way our culture works. One of the first memories I have is of being forced to wake up early in the cold dark winter morning and sent out to the kindergarten. When you're a kid, there's nothing much you can do about the way society and your parents want you to behave. Then you have to sit at school, then at uni, then at work. We become really good with eating it up and suppressing our feelings, but without expressing them they tend to pile up and cause problems in the subconscious mind.

Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/aEGukyCsHMg), which kind of backs up my version.

The good news is that just journaling or talking about your feelings helps a lot! Because words "live" in the same hemisphere that actively suppresses emotions and plans your actions, by assigning words to your feelings, you create new connections between hemispheres, literally reconnecting with yourself.

I first encountered this emotions wheel thing at the shrinks in 2018 when I suffered from severe depression and took a photo of it for future reference. *Turned out *it is super unusable on a screen because of its circular nature.

So I present you this useful rotating feelings wheel.

Rendered with d3.js from .yaml files, it allows for feelings and emotions to be added as soon as they are discovered by scientists!

## How to use

Ok, so let's say you're feeling something. You're not sure what that is, but it's defiitely "bad". Oh we actually have a whole "bad" sector. Let's spin to the pink and see, maybe you're feeling stressed? Yeah looks like it. When you think about it, you realize you've been feeling overwhelmed by all the stuff you have to to do at your job and also in your life. Ok now we got something to think about. I suggest taking at least 5 minutes to write down your thoughts and feelings around this word, that situation. Also try to realize if there’s a part of your body which is partularly afflicted by this feeling.
